List of differences between ODEs in Iwamoto Table B.1 and those
generated by the model

ODE	Problem				Fix???
0	(k3/k4)				Follow the diagrams. ODEs likely incorrect
6	k7/Y7				Used Y7. ODEs likely incorrect
7	(k35/k24)			Follow the diagrams. ODEs likely incorrect
9	(k30/k36)			Follow the diagrams. ODEs likely incorrect
12	(k30/k36)			Follow the diagrams. ODEs likely incorrect
18	fraction			Ignored. No noticeable difference in simulation
19	missing '+'			Follow the diagrams. ODEs likely incorrect
22	(Y22/Y24)			Follow the diagrams. ODEs likely incorrect
23	fraction			Ignored. No noticeable difference in simulation
24	Degradation			Modeled two monomers
25	fraction & powers	Overridden 
27	k70 fraction		Overridden, but not far from working properly
